# Styledwind

**Styledwind** is a `CSS-in-JS` library that combines ideas from **Tailwind**-like shorthands and dynamic style injection (similar to **styled-components**). It provides features such as theme/palette management, breakpoints, container queries, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, and runtime style updates via an intuitive API.
